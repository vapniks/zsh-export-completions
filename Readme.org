* zsh-export-completions
zsh module to export completions and corresponding descriptions into parameters
The motivation for this module is to create a completion widget using the [[https://github.com/zsh-users/zaw][zaw]] plugin that would allow matching on both completions and their descriptions.

** Building
To build the module, 
 1) place completions.c and completions.mdd in the Src/Zle subdirectory of the zsh repository
 2) run configure in the toplevel dir: ./configure --prefix=/path/to/zsh-source-dir --enable-zsh-debug
    (add --enable-zsh-debug if you are debugging the code)
 3) make clean
 4) Edit config.modules in the toplevel directory and add the following line:
 =name=zsh/completions modfile=Src/Zle/completions.mdd link=dynamic auto=yes load=no=
 5) make prep
 6) make

To rebuild the module after making a few changes do "make clean" followed by "make"

** TODO Things to do
 - obtain the completions and descriptions
 - export them as parameter(s)

NOTE: Vincent Breitmoser has a working method for capturing completions without the use of any extra modules: https://github.com/Valodim/zsh-capture-completion
